Hugo's Shell. You can call C functions from libraries linked at compile time.
You can link more libraries if you want. 

                                  Limitations
It only accepts values of the following types: const int, const float and const
string. It assumes that all functions return int. 

                                     Errors
The floats are parsed correctly but printf can't print it. I don't know what
happens.
